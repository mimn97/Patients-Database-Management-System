# Additional Feature used for the Project

The project 'Appointments-Management-System' is mainly created for
healthcare providers or workers to manage appointment schedules efficiently, 
through using appointment management API and several html pages. 

Any user can see all records of previously/currently-scheduled appointments, patients, 
doctors, and symptoms or diagnosis that the patients have been suffered from when making an appointment. 

Additional feature that I have used for this project was creating a HTML web page 
with a form that can be used to add information to the database 
of this API. I created an HTML form in the '\add' page to add a new appointment 
to the database. This enables the user to fill in several required information that is 
needed to fulfill the required information (columns) that the table 'app' possesses.  
The first two boxes are a patient's first name and last name, and those two columns are unique. The next three boxes are
gender, age, and date of birth of the patient, respectively. First name of a doctor is also unique. 
Month and symptoms are finally text value. 

Those information is then automatically registered to the database after clicking the 'submit' button, where
the user also confirms the newly added appointment in the existing database by clicking the page 'Back to appointments.'
